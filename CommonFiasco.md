# The Score

Second String at Best

“For every successful superhero who was belted by gamma rays, inject-
ed with magic ginseng or... for instance... bit by a radioactive spider like
Spiderman, there are many, many more who are not so spectacular.”

--Flaming Carrot Comics, by Bob Burden

Somewhere out there, Solarman is saving the world from an invasive al-
ternate reality full of insect-men. Somewhere else, the Wonder League
fights for truth and justice against big name villains like Baron von Vio-
lence. And somewhere else, the superscientist Professor Chrysalis is
discovering a cure for all known diseases.

That’s not here, though. Sure, you work in the same “costumed aggres-
sion” industry as those guys. But you aren’t the big name heroes or vil-
lains. You aren’t even the henchmen of the top tier villains. You’re
down with the dregs. Third rate heroes, has-been villains and minions
who couldn’t even get hired as cannon fodder. These are a bunch of
people with poor social skills, terrible impulse control, giant ambitions
and access to deadly superscientific doomsday devices. When their
personal lives get all muddled up into their professional hero and vil-
lain routine, it’s sure to be a fiasco.

“It’s about the beauty of failure. It’s about that failure happens to all of
us... Every character is not only flawed, but sucks at what they do, and
is beautiful at it and Jackson and I suck at what we do, and we try to
be beautiful at it, and failure is how you get by... It shows that failure’s
funny, and it’s beautiful and it’s life, and it’s okay, and it’s all we can
write because we are big... failures. (Laughter).”

# Common Fiasco

Common Fiasco is a narrative role playing game, for 3, 4 or 5 players.  The
players will invent and tell a story all togheter, describing the scenes and
playing the protagonists. The game is very light by purpose: the focus is in
having fun during this co-authoring event.

The game provides a simple way to setup the initial scenario, to create the
characters, and a way to semi-randomly choose plot twists and the detinies of
the characters.

## Game setup

Select randomly the player order, and put a white sheet in the center of the
table, and one between each player and the next one. The last one is supposed to
be followed by the first one (e.g. pretend to sit at a round table), so a sheet
must be placed between them too.

The first player, or anyone wants, read to the other players the lore text at
the beginnig of the "The Score" section.  Then a random scenario for the right
number of players is selected. The items in the scenario must be copyed in the
respective sheet, for example, if in the scenario is written:

- Player-1
  - __Relationship__ Family - Brother and Sister
  - __Need__ To become rich - Robbin a bank
- Player-2
  - ...

write on the sheet between Player-1 and Player-2 something like:

- Brother and Sister
- To become rich robbin a bank

The __Relationship__, __Need__, __Object__ and __Location__ tags may be
omitted, as any other redundant information like "Family". As said, the items
after the last player must be written on the sheet between the last and the
first player.

## Customized scenario

Instead of using a standard scenario, you can create a custom one in the
following way. In the player order, each player will select a random page
of the score containing scenarios. Such player can take any __Relationship__
inside that page and print it on any of the sheet between the players. When
all the __Relationship__ are chosen, the players select in the same way a
__Need__ ar an __Object__ or a __Location__. Again, the new item can be added
anywhere, but the following rules must be satisfied:

- Only one item (other than __Relationship__) can be written on a single sheet.
- At least one __Need__ one __Object__ and one __Location__ must be written on
  every sheet.
- No __Relationship__, __Need__, __Object__ and __Location__ may be repeated.

## Finish the scenario

Now the players should discuss for fully defining the initial situation and the
controlled characters.

The __Relationship__ often is asymmetric, as in "Employer and Emploee", so you
need to define who is what. In this phase you should define the
__Relationship__ as far you need to make it intriguing, for example you almost
certainly want to define the type of buisness they work in, but do not be
afraid to insert other details, for example there could be a customer
particularly important for them...

The __Need__ should give you a strong hint on which the situation is, guess for
example to "Become rich robbing a bank".  __Object__ and __Location__ can add
detail of how a plan can be carried out. Just, remember that all these details
must be important for both the characters between it is placed, but they may
touch also the other ones

When all is set, each player can give a name to the controlled character, writing
it in a sheet in front of him. All the players must be able to see this sheet
since during the game other thigs will be added to it.

Finally, write in sheet in the middle of the table, 2 crosses and 2 circles for
each character. For example in a 3 player games write:

X X X O O O

X X X O O O

## Playing the scenes

By turns a character is under the spot, it is the "Active" character, while the
controlling player is the "Active" player. A scene will be set-up, played and
resolved for the active character, then will be the turn of the next player at
the left.

The active player have to decide if to "Enstabilish" or to "Resolve" the scene.
If the active player chose to enstabilish, the other players will resolve all
togheter; if the active player chose instead to resolve, another player will be
selected for Estabilish. If more players have good ideas, the active player
will decide who of them will enstabilish the scene.

The player who enstabilish the scene, decide who is in the scene other than the
active player, where the scene is set, and any other starting detail. Also
characters other than controlled by the players may be inserted; they may be
temporary assigned by the Estabilishing player to onother player (also
himself/herself). It is also good, to define what the active character
are trying to do in the scene is defined (just make sure that the active player
agrees if is someone else that is enstabilishing). This would help in
deciding how to resolve the scene but is not mandatory: you can also simply set
the scene, and let the goals of the active player to emerge during the play.

The scene normally are in temporal order, so that the next scene will be
in a later time respect the previous; however this is not mandatory, you can
construct flashback scenes if you like, maybe to explain why the characters
act in a certain way. Or you may be forced to tell a flashback because the
active character died in some previous scene...

When the scene is set, all the included player start to play it. The may describe
how the character acts, or can directly impersonate them, talking with wierd
voices, or whatever is in the spirit of the current game. In any case, let the
character explore the scene whitout changing too much the assumption: you have
to understand how it ends, not to generate a new scene; that will be the job
for the next turn.

The resolution may happen any time during the scene. If the active player
choosed to Resolve, this happen when he/she communicates to the other
players that the scene must end with a positive or negative outcome. If the
active player chose to Enstabilish, the resolution happens when the other players
agrees that it should end positively or negatively.

Sometimes may not be clear for someone how it should end, or even if a resolution
is to be considered positive or negative. In such case, just
interrupt the scene asking what the others thing about the scene.

However, normally, it is desirable that the scene comes to an ending without
interrupting the telling or the acting. So a "Silent" system could be use for
deciding and comunicating the outcome. For example, the players can agree that
the decision is made counting the number of thumb up or thumb down shown by the
resolving players. If no unanimous consense is found, we suggest that at least
2 players votes for the same outcome (3 in a 5-players game). Obviously if is
the active player to resolve the scene, his/her single decision is enough.

When the decision is made, the player that is enstabilishing the scene just
start telling how the character failed or successed according to the outcome
that was choesen. If some other player has a good idea to close the scene
respecting the outcome, he/she can ask to the enstabilishing player to tell the
story for him/her.

If the outcome is positive, the active player delete a circle from the central
sheet and write one on the sheet with the name of the active character. If it
is negative, a cross is deleted and writed instead (if you have token instead
of crosses and circles, the active player can just take the
corresponding one).

If on the central sheet are left crosses only, or circles only, the outcome of
the scene is dictated from what is avaiable. The resolving players may not
decide if it is positive or negative, but may decide when the scene ends.

Continue in this way until every characted had 2 scenes. Than perform the "Tilt"
phase. Then play again in the same way, with the new element added by the tilt
for other 2 scenes per character. Then perfrom the "Ending" phase. For example in
a 3 player game there will be: 6 scenes, then the tilt, then other 6 scenes, then
the ending.

## Tilt and Ending

What happen in tilt and int the ending depends on the number of corsses and circle
each character have. It is designed so that the player with the higher
difference in cross and circle are rewarded, and the controlled character
counld have a better ending. For example having equal number of cross and
circless will make possible the character to die in the ending, or worst.

After each characted had 2 scenes, the tilt happens. The player with more
crosses (randomly resolve the ties) takes a random tilt option sheet, and
he/she will freely choose a tilt from the list. The selected one is written in
the sheet in the middle, then the same sequence is repeated for the player with
more circles.

These are two new elements that must be indoduced into the story. It may
happens right in the next scene, or maybe in the last one, the important is try
to direct the events in that direction.

After the tilt the game continues for other 2 scenes per character; so when
each character had 4 scenes the ending happens.

First each player in turn may decide to give one of his/her cross or circle to
another player, telling why he/she decided to help or to oppose the other
character.

Then the score for each character must be calculated, launching two dice and
summing the differences of crosses and circles for each character (maximum
minus minimum). For example if a character has 1 cross and 3 circles,
and roll a 3 and a 5, the score is 3-1 +3 +5 = 10. If there was 3
crosses and 1 circle, the result would be exactly same score.

Look at the ending corresponding to that score in the ending table.  Each
player in turn will tell ending of the story of the controller character in a
way that respect both the story told until then, and the ending hint.

After that, the game is over, we hope you enjoined Common Fiasco.
