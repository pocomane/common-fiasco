# Common Fiasco

Common Fiasco is a tabletop RPG heavly based on (Fiasco Classic)[1].  This
is not meant as a substitution of the original text by Jason Morningstar, that
contains a lot of material, ideas and suggestion absent here, inclusive of an
example session transcription.

⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅

The main reason for writing this is to have a fully Creative Commons (CC0)
version that can be shared with anyone. This let you to use it as as base
for other work (you can also sell it without giving any credit to anyone).

The game structure, as in the original opera, is very very light. This make
it ideal for a quick test any ambientation that is in your head. Or to add some
specific mechanin and see the result.

The text is kept short so you can include it in any playset, making them
practically standalone games.

The changes in the setup are mede hoping to simplify and speed-up that phase.

The following files are provided:
- [Common Fiasco](CommonFiasco.md) - If you want to modify the game, or create
  a new one starting from it, you can use this file (it is the simpler to edit);
  it contains rule plus a scenario without any credit; it is released under CC0
- [Common Fiasco](https://github.com/pocomane/common-fiasco/releases/latest/download/CommonFiasco.pdf) -
  Same as the previous file, but in PDF format
- [Common Ambientations](https://github.com/pocomane/common-fiasco/releases/latest/download/CommonFiasco.pdf) -
  a collection of ambientation distributed uder Creative Commons or public
  domain (main rules included)
- [Single ambientation](https://github.com/pocomane/common-fiasco/releases/latest) - the
  other PDFs in the release page are the single playsets distributed as a
  single file, togheter with the rules.

All the proposet playsets are adapted from ones for Fiasco Classic, freely found
in the internet.

Please note that THE RULE SECTION IS A DRAFT. THE RULES PROBABLY WILL NOT BE
CHANGED AT ALL, BUT THE TEXT NEEDS A REVISION.

# Using Fiasco Classic playsets

The playsets for Common Fiasco are organized in a different way from
the ones fro the original game. This reflects the changes in the setup. To
adapt a scenario to Common Fiasco, the best way probably is to manually
make the scenarios selecting the rlationship, needs, objects and location
with the same contraint of the "Customized Setup" described in the rules.

You have to make 9 scenarios for 3 players, 9 for 4 players and 9 for 5 players.
You have to use each original need, object and location exactly one time. Each
relationship must intead be used 3 times.

If you want a "Braindead" convertion, you can simply copy the original items
in the 27 scenraios following the next template; this will result practically in
"Random" generated scenarios.
