# The Score - Hellmouth High

A strange adolescence

Sure, here in this sleepy coastal suburb, we have high-quality public
education, easy beach access, 330 days of sunshine a year, and
seemingly no good right to complain.
But the living here isn’t exactly easy: the jerk jocks and alpha
bitches make life unbearable for anyone who doesn’t fit their
narrow definition of cool. Then there’s the truly weird crap: the
disappearances, the exsanguinations, the demon possessions, the
ancient curses, and all the damn vampires.
So you keep your head down, mind your own business, and hope
the hyenas don’t smell your fear. You let your friends keep you sane,
that motley assortment of freaks and geeks bound together by mutual
awkwardness.
And maybe, just maybe, if you don’t fuck up too bad, you might
score a little respect, score that winning touchdown, score with the
homecoming queen. Hell, you might even make it out of here alive.
