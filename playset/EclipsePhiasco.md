# The Score - Eclipse Phiasco

A fiasco is approaching. Survive it.

Humanity has become transhumanity. Uplifted animals and conscious
software have joined the ranks of the sentient. Starvation, death, and
disease are things of the past. Technological advances have eliminated
practically all vital needs, but one thing has stayed the same:
everybody has an angle.
In Ecologene’s Martian habitat, nothing is as it seems. The powerful
bioengineering hypercorp does its best to keep its citizens happy and
compliant, but below the surface is a conspiratorial web of intrigue.
And you’re about to become a part of it.
This is a playset based on the transhuman world of Eclipse Phase. If
you are unfamiliar with Eclipse Phase, check it out!

## Optional Special Rules

Death and resleeving

Technology has reduced death to a major inconvenience. If your character
dies, they are probably not actually dead. As long as they have a backup of
their mind stored somewhere and a means to sleeve into a new morph, they
should be fine. This is usually handled via backup insurance.
Death in your fiasco can be handled in any combination of these ways,
depending on the circumstances:
1. The character is resleeved from their cortical stack. They retain all
memories up to and including their death.
2. The character is resleeved from a backup. They only remember as far
as they did when they were last backed up.
3. The character might get resleeved at some point, but it will be a while
before that happens. For the purposes of the game, they are dead.
4. For some reason, the character cannot be resleeved. They are
permanently dead.
