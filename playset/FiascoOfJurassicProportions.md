# The Score - Fiasco of Jurassic Proportions

WELCOME...*dramatic pause*...TO JURASSIC PARK

Welcome to Isla Nublar, home to mankind’s latest attempt at playing
god. While the first Jurassic Park was a disaster (ok, maybe the first few
iterations were complete disasters), you find yourself at the newest
dinosaur-themed cash grab. The theme park is up and running, people
are dying to see the animals for themselves, and the security team has
assured us that nothing could possibly go wrong. I’ve even heard rumors
of some new dinosaurs that are set to debut soon! Whether you are a
stockholder, a parent treating your family to a prehistoric vacation, or
have ulterior motives for visiting, welcome to Jurassic Park.

## Special Rules

Stunt dice

Before starting, remove two white dice and two black dice from
the dice pool, and replace them with four red stunt dice. Then roll them
all to kick off the game as normal. Whenever a stunt die is picked to
resolve a scene, someone dies. Usually this will be an NPC, but don’t be
afraid to kill a PC this way. Be creative! There are plenty of unique deaths
in the Jurassic Park franchise, so don’t be afraid to have your lawyer
character get eaten by a T-rex while on a toilet. Whichever player picks
the stunt die to resolve the scene gets to decide whether that die is
white or black for that scene. During the Aftermath, don’t roll any of the
stunt dice. They won’t affect your final outcome, but symbolize those
visitors and staff who got to “hand feed” the hungry dinosaurs.
