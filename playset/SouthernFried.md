# The Score - Southern Fried

LORD WILLIN’ AND THE CREEK DON’T RISE

Moxley’s a small southern town chock-full of people who know what it
means to put in a hard day’s work. A place where folks say “yes sir” and
“no ma’am,” and put in the effort to get to know you a little better.
Maybe they know a little too much and spread it around a little, but
they’ll tell you they don’t mean no harm. Lucky for you, mama didn’t
raise no fool, and you get the sense there’s something more going on
around here. Whether you stay on the narrow path and make an honest
living or supplement your income through unsavory pursuits, you’re
liable to learn a little something about yourself, your kin, your friends,
and this town you weren’t prepared for. You can try to hide the truth, but
sure as rain clouds come in June, it can’t stay hidden forever.
