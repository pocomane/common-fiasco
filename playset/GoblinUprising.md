# The Score - Goblin Uprising

The Goblins are Coming

My king, the goblins of the eastern kingdoms threaten us all. Our
scouts have heard rumours of raids on the Halfling homesteads and
assaults on the elven settlements in the Morkwood. Strange noises
have been heard within their putrid warrens and our wizards have
sensed a surge of dark energies.
As you know, the goblins are small in body but great in ambition.
They have a devious cunning and an innate skill for destruction.
They breed in large numbers, cast primitive sorceries, and consort
with all sorts of monsters. Most dangerous of all, they have blatant
disregard for their own petty lives.
Our only hope is that they are too busy fighting each other, sire.
