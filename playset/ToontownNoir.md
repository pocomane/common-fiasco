# The Score - Toontown Noir

Once Upon A Toon...

Hollywoodland is even stranger now that Toontown is right next
door. People have adjusted to talking animals driving talking cars
and gorilla bouncers in tiny tuxes. But it’s not all laughter and
hijinks. Even toons have their dastardly deeds and dark desires.
They are flawed, just as we are. For they are human creations,
interacting with humans. They reflect ourselves back as though
through a funhouse mirror, passions stretched outlandishly,
self-control squished to nothing. They may make you laugh, but
you should still watch your back. There’s no telling what might
happen Once Upon A Toon…
