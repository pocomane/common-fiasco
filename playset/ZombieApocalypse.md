# The Score - Zombie apocalypse

No Rest for the Living

Chicago  is  burning.  So  is  Los  Angeles,  New  York  City,  Dallas,  Minneapolis,  Boston,  Fort  
Wayne,  Columbus...  the  cities  are  bad  places  now.  They’re  home  to  the  undead  mindless  
hordes.  
In  the  Before,  you  thought  zombies  were  a  reasonable  subject  for  indie  comedies.  These  
days,  in  the  After,  you  don’t  ﬁnd  them  quite  as  amusing  any  more.  The  one  thing  your  
Before  self  and  your  After  self  can  agree  on  is  this:  zombies  are  way  overplayed.
It  would  be  nice  if  that  was  the  worst  of  your  problems.  Alas,  you  don’t  get  to  pick  your  
fellow  survivors.  They  picked  themselves  using  criteria  you  do  not  share.  You  need  them;  
there  are  more  zombies  than  survivors  by  now,  not  that  anyone’s  counting.  Like  them?  
Well,  that’s  another  kettle  of  twitching  dismembered  zombie  limbs.
It’s  dawn.  You’ve  survived  another  night  living  cheek  to  jowl  with  your  small  band  of  
fellow  survivors.  You  have  a  bit  of  food  and  a  box  of  ammo  and  a  rusty  machete.  
Everything  smells.  Good  luck  making  it  another  twenty–four  hours.

## Movie night

Night  of  the  Living  Dead,  Dawn  of  the  Living  Dead,  Zombie  (Fulci),  Walking  Dead  (TV).  If  
you  want  more  comedy  in  your  undead  horrors,  Shaun  of  the  Dead,  Zombie  Beach  Party,  
and  Dead  and  Breakfast.
