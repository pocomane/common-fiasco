# The Score - Way out West

“Hey there pioneers! Did you know that in the 1840's, folks of all kinds
left their homes in the east to travel down the trail to Oregon? Yep,
whether they were carpenters, bankers, or heck, even farmers! All three
kinds of people. Yep, it was America's original cross-country road trip.
And today, pioneers, you've caught the Oregon fever. And now it's time
to name your family and take them down the trail.” - Father (Trail to
Oregon)

## Realism

Play up the different occupations that each of your characters would
have had. We can’t all be bankers in real life, filling our wagon to the
brim with 18 oxen, 2000 pounds of food, 2o sets of clothes, and 3 of
each spare part. Why not be a farmer, who’s skills will be totally useless
on the trail! Whatever your reason for traveling west, it was nice knowing
you! Also, while funny tombstones were not realistic, don’t be afraid to
make your own eulogies in honor of your character’s low-intelligence
choice to eat those wild berries you found in the middle of the road!

## Optional Special Rules

Stunt dice

Before starting, remove two white dice and two black dice from
the dice pool, and replace them with four red stunt dice. Then roll them
all to kick off the game as normal. Whenever a stunt die is picked to
resolve a scene, someone dies. Usually this will be an NPC, but don’t be
afraid to kill a PC this way. Be creative! Don’t be afraid to drown them,
give them dysentery, murder them with typhoid fever, rattlesnake bites,
run them over with the wagon, oh my! Whichever player picks the stunt
die to resolve the scene gets to decide whether that die is white or black
for that scene. During the Aftermath, don’t roll any of the stunt dice. They
won’t affect your final outcome, but symbolize those party members
who weren’t fortunate enough to make it out West.
