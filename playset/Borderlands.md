# The Score - Borderlands

A philosopher once described life
as “nasty, Brutish and short”

so are you

Just on the edge of the human kingdom lies a valley whose cliff faces
are riddled with caves. In these caves dwell a surprising variety of
monstrous races: sneaky goblins, downtrodden kobolds, savage orcs,
enormous ogres and stranger things still. These monstrous peoples
are only tenuously united by the common worship of the bloody god
Zemox.
The human Baron of Restwell Keep is supposed to keep the monsters
under control, but there isn’t much he can do. Sure, every year or two
you get a couple of self proclaimed “heroes” coming in to wipe out
the monsters. But most of these adventuresome kids wind up on the
wrong end of a glaive-guisarme. The monsters, they stick around.
The biggest threat to the monsters isn’t the human warriors, but the
constant infighting between monstrous tribes. Gathering together
this many violent subhumans in one place is a surefire recipe for di-
saster. The valley is a fiasco, just waiting to happen.

## Movie night

Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, Invader Zim, Labyrinth, Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are Dead (really), any low budget or badly made
fantasy movie (perhaps the terrible D&D movies)
